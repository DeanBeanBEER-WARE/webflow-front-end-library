Plugin Classes to Simplify Webflow Interaction Panels
This repository contains a set of plugin classes I've developed to streamline and improve the usability of interaction panels in webflows. Many panels are often bloated with unnecessary features, making the user experience slower and less intuitive. These plugins aim to solve that by providing a more lightweight, user-friendly approach.

Purpose
The goal is to minimize overly complex interaction panels and replace them with concise, intuitive, and efficient interfaces. This will help speed up user interactions and make the overall flow smoother, without the clutter of unnecessary elements.

Common Issues with Default Webflows:
Overloaded Interfaces: Panels often have too many functions packed into them, which can overwhelm users.
Performance Issues: Heavy, overly complex panels can result in slow load times and a laggy experience.
User Confusion: Poorly structured UI and complicated navigation can frustrate users and reduce their efficiency.
Solution:
These plugin classes provide a simple and modular way to tackle these problems by offering:

Minimalist Interfaces: Only the essential features are presented.
Optimized Performance: By reducing unnecessary elements, the overall performance is improved.
Customizable Design: Each plugin is adaptable and can be integrated flexibly depending on the webflow environment.
Better User Experience: Users can perform tasks more quickly and without confusion due to the streamlined interface.
Key Features
Easy Integration: These plugins are simple to implement in any existing webflow.
Modular Design: Only enable the features you need—no more, no less.
Mobile-Friendly: All plugins are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes automatically.
Improved User Interactions: Optimized UI for faster and smoother user interactions.
Code Example
Here’s a snippet that demonstrates how you can use the filter functionality:

javascript
Code kopieren
const filterConfigs = [
    {
        filterTarget: '.item',
        containerClass: '.filter-buttons',
        useAttributeFilter: true,
        attributeName: 'data-category',
        buttonClass: 'filter-btn',
        buttonActiveClass: 'active',
    },
    {
        filterTarget: '.product',
        containerClass: '.product-filters',
        filterFunction: (element, value) => {
            return element.dataset.type === value;
        },
        filters: [
            { value: 'electronics', text: 'Electronics' },
            { value: 'clothing', text: 'Clothing' },
            { value: 'books', text: 'Books' },
        ],
        buttonClass: 'product-filter-btn',
        buttonActiveClass: 'selected',
    }
];

const filterManager = new Filter(filterConfigs);
In this example, two different filter configurations are applied:

The first one uses attribute filtering to filter items based on their data-category.
The second one filters products based on a custom function, with predefined filter buttons for specific product categories like "Electronics," "Clothing," and "Books."
Installation
Installation is super simple:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Import the classes into your project as needed and integrate them into your webflow.
Customize the configuration to suit your specific panel or filter needs.
